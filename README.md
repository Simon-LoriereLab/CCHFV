# CCHFV
This repository analyzes genomes of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) circulating worldwide using Nextstrain. The build was constructed using a total of 163 CCHFV full-length genomes (all 3 segments).

This work is ongoing, please do not hesitate to contact us if this could be relevant to your work!

The phylogenies of each segment (S, M and L) can be visualized at https://nextstrain.org/community/Simon-LoriereLab/CCHFV@main/S .

This work is made possible by the open sharing of genetic data by research groups from all over the world. We gratefully acknowledge their contributions.
